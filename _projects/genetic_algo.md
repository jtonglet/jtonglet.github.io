Implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve large assymetric travelingsalesman problems. The implementation was part of a project for the course Genetic Algorithms & Evolutionary Computing taught at KU Leuven in 2022-2023 by Professor Nick Vannieuwenhoven.

The algorithm combines mutation and crossover operators, diversity promotion through fitness sharing, and exploitation with a local search operator. The algorithm achieves a good performance within 5 minutes on tours ranging from 50 to 1000 cities.
